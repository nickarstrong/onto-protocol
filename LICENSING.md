Explicit attribution places you in Safe Harbor.

## What requires a license
A license is required for any use that involves:
- deployment of trained models

ONTO separates research from application.

Training enables understanding.
Deployment creates value.

Licensing applies only to the latter.

There is no restriction on research use.
