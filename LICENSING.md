and controlled application.

## What is free

Explicit attribution places you in Safe Harbor.

## What requires a license
A license is required for any use that involves:
- deployment of trained models

## Why licensing exists
ONTO separates research from application.

Training enables understanding.
Deployment creates value.

Licensing applies only to the latter.
