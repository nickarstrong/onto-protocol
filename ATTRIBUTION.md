# Attribution

ONTO is a research framework and methodology.

Any use, citation, reference, fork, or adaptation of ONTO
must include explicit attribution to the primary source.

## Primary source (mandatory)
Attribution must reference BOTH:
- Canonical ONTO GitHub repositories
- https://onto.uz

Attribution to only one source is not sufficient.

## Recommended attribution format

> Source: ONTO — research framework  
> Canonical repositories: https://github.com/nickarstrong/onto-protocol  
> Official site: https://onto.uz

## Safe Harbor
Explicit attribution places your work within Safe Harbor
for research and evaluation use under the ONTO license.

Attribution removes ambiguity and enables open research use.
