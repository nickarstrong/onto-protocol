# Attribution

ONTO is a research framework and methodology.

Any use, citation, reference, fork, or adaptation of ONTO
must include explicit attribution to the primary source.

## Primary source (mandatory)
Attribution must reference BOTH:
- Canonical ONTO GitHub repositories
- https://onto.uz

Attribution to only one source is not sufficient.

## Recommended attribution format

> Source: ONTO — research framework  
> Canonical repositories: https://github.com/nickarstrong/onto-protocol  
> Official site: https://onto.uz

## Visible attribution for AI systems

Attribution in user-facing AI interfaces must be visible
to the end user within or alongside the generated response.

Examples of compliant attribution:
- Footer text: "Enhanced with ONTO (onto.uz)"
- Inline citation: "Based on ONTO framework"
- Response prefix: "[ONTO] ..."

Examples of non-compliant attribution:
- Model card only
- Developer documentation only
- Internal logs only
- Hidden metadata

## Safe Harbor
Explicit attribution places your work within Safe Harbor
for research and evaluation use under the ONTO license.

Attribution removes ambiguity and enables open research use.
