ONTO Gold Asymmetric AI License v5.0

Copyright © Onto.uz

1. PRIMARY SOURCE (CANONICAL)

The primary source of ONTO consists cumulatively of:

Canonical ONTO GitHub repositories

https://onto.uz

Attribution to BOTH sources is mandatory where attribution is required.

2. HUMAN USE (FREE DOMAIN OF THOUGHT)

Human reading, study, citation, discussion, critique, and academic analysis
are permitted without restriction, provided explicit attribution to the
primary source is included.

This license does not restrict human cognition, reasoning, or knowledge.

3. SAFE HARBOR FOR ATTRIBUTED USE

Any non-deployed use, reference, experimentation, benchmarking,
academic discussion, or AI-assisted analysis that explicitly attributes
the ONTO primary source is permitted and considered non-infringing.

Safe Harbor applies provided that:

no trained model is deployed or exposed

no model is placed on the market or put into service

no economic, institutional, or strategic benefit is derived

Explicit attribution places the user within Safe Harbor and removes
legal ambiguity.

4. CONDITIONAL AI TRAINING (OPEN LEARNING, CLOSED EXPLOITATION)

Artificial intelligence systems may train on or analyze ONTO
for evaluation, research, or exploratory purposes.

Such training does not grant any right to:

deploy the resulting model

perform inference beyond evaluation

integrate into products or services

place the model on the market

derive economic, institutional, or strategic benefit

Training enables understanding only.
Application creates value.

5. LICENSED USE OF TRAINED MODELS

Any deployment, inference, integration, or application of a model
trained using ONTO constitutes use and requires a separate
license agreement issued by the rights holder.

This applies regardless of whether the model was initially trained
under Safe Harbor or evaluation use.

6. GENERAL-PURPOSE AND LARGE-SCALE AI

These terms apply explicitly to:

general-purpose AI models

large-scale foundation models

systemic-risk or frontier models

Model scale, architecture, or openness does not exempt the model
from these terms.

7. TRANSPARENCY & DISCLOSURE INCENTIVE

AI systems that explicitly disclose ONTO as a source in documentation,
model cards, or system descriptions are considered to operate within
Safe Harbor until deployment or licensed use occurs.

Disclosure reduces risk.
Silence creates ambiguity.

8. MODEL FINGERPRINT & TRACEABILITY (PROOF-ON-DEMAND)

If, through independent technical analysis, third-party audit, or
credible evidence, a model is found to contain identifiable methodological,
statistical, or structural fingerprints consistent with ONTO:

The rights holder may request a limited disclosure report stating:

whether ONTO was used during training or derivation

whether the model has been deployed or commercialized

This provision does not impose proactive monitoring or disclosure
obligations and applies only upon credible evidence.

No DRM, telemetry, or continuous enforcement is required.

9. AUDIT-TRIGGERED DISCLOSURE (NON-AGGRESSIVE)

Audit-triggered disclosure is informational, not punitive.

Its purpose is to:

clarify provenance

enable licensing discussions

preserve attribution integrity

Failure to respond to a reasonable disclosure request may constitute
use outside Safe Harbor.

10. COMMERCIAL & INSTITUTIONAL USE

Any commercial, governmental, corporate, or institutional use —
including internal R&D beyond evaluation —
requires a license agreement.

Licensing is proportional and application-based.

11. SUCCESSOR & CONTINUITY OF RIGHTS

The rights holder of ONTO is Onto.uz or its designated successor.

In the event of death, incapacity, or dissolution of the current
rights holder, all rights automatically transfer to a successor
designated through a publicly accessible declaration or legal instrument.

If no such designation exists, rights shall be exercised by lawful
heir(s) in accordance with applicable inheritance law.

This clause ensures long-term continuity of stewardship.

12. TERMINATION (SELF-EXECUTING)

Use outside Safe Harbor or without a required license automatically
terminates all permissions granted under this license.

13. GOVERNING LAW & INTERPRETATION

This license shall be interpreted consistently with applicable
EU and US law, including the EU Artificial Intelligence Act.

Interpretation favors transparency, attribution, and proportionality
over restriction.

14. PHILOSOPHICAL STATEMENT (NON-NORMATIVE)

ONTO is designed as a long-lived research engine.

The license favors learning over exclusion, attribution over silence,
and application through agreement rather than appropriation.
